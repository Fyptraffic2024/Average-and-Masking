# Object Extraction from Video using YOLOv8

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that extracts specific objects from video frames using bounding box coordinates stored in a CSV file. The objects are cropped and saved as images using the YOLOv8 segmentation model.

## üìÅ Files

- `Extract_Object.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the object extraction logic.
- Your YOLOv8 model weights (e.g., `yolov8n-seg.pt`) must be available in the same directory or provide the full path.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python-headless pandas torch
Alternatively, you can use a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Add a requirements.txt file if needed.

üß† Model
This project uses the YOLOv8 segmentation model. Download YOLOv8 weights from Ultralytics if you don't have them already:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Example command to download YOLOv8n-seg
yolo download model=yolov8n-seg
üì• Inputs
CSV File
A CSV containing the following columns:

ID: Object ID

Frame: Frame number in the video

x1, y1, x2, y2: Bounding box coordinates for the object

Video File
A standard video file (e.g., .mp4 or .avi) from which objects will be extracted.

YOLO Model File
The pretrained YOLOv8 segmentation weights (e.g., yolov8n-seg.pt).

üöÄ How to Run
You can run the code either by opening the Jupyter Notebook or converting it to a script.

Jupyter Notebook
Launch Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open Extract_Object.ipynb

Run the notebook cells, providing your CSV path, video file path, object ID, and output folder.

Python Script (Optional)
If you convert the notebook to a script (e.g., extract.py), usage will look like:

python
Copy
Edit
from extract_script import extract_objects_from_video

extract_objects_from_video(
    csv_file="path/to/detections.csv",
    video_file="path/to/video.mp4",
    object_id=1,
    output_folder="cropped_objects"
)
üìÇ Output
Cropped object images are saved to the specified output folder, named as:

php-template
Copy
Edit
object_<ID>_frame_<FrameNumber>.jpg
üìå Notes
Ensure that frame numbers in the CSV file exist in the video.

Bounding boxes must be within frame dimensions to avoid errors.
